# fwsp-queuer
Queue creation and management.

> _Queuer - One who, or that which, queues; a person waiting in line._

So not that kind of Queuer. This module was named to complement [fwsp-cacher](https://github.com/flywheelsports/fwsp-cacher), but focused on Redis queues.

## installation

```
npm install fwsp-queuer --save
```

## usage

See `./test` folder for example.
